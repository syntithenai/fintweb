Hi, I'm <i>Steven John Ryan</i><br/>
<b>Syntithenai</b>, a greek word for synthesis appeals to me. Fitting software components together. Building gardens. Creating just feels good.

<div id="business" class="contentblock">
<h1>Professional</h1>
My university education was in mathematics and biochemistry but I've been playing with computer software since I was a child.
I have worked a contract software developer for the last fifteen years specialising in browser based software.  In a word ... HTML5
I am a fan of open standards and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> technologies. I believe the great strength of the Internet is as a sphere for collaboration and cooperation.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"><img src="images/opensource.jpg" border="0"></a>
I have helped many clients deploy network database applications based on the  <a href="http://typo3.org/">Typo3 content management system</a>.<br>

<h1>Music</h1>
<img src="images/trebleclef.jpg">
I am a passionate musician. There are few things as fulfilling as being lost in the moment of improvisation.<br> Improvisation is the synthesis of musical structure into a moment in time and place and people.<br><br>
I am lucky to be able to experience music as something that is done rather than consumed. Taking part in the union of voices in a choir is a thing of great beauty.<br>
As music teacher, I hope I have been successful in passing on the enjoyment of making music.

<div id="peppertrees" class="contentblock">
<h1>Home</h1>
I own and live on a five acre property (Peppertrees) in the middle of farmland close to Bega, NSW Australia. Over the last four years I have planted approximately 1000 trees and created extensive vegetable gardens.<br><br>
<img src="images/permaculturegarden.jpg">
 I have learnt much from the design principals of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">permaculture</a>. <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture"><img src="images/permaculture.jpg" border="0"></a>
Particularly the importance of patient observation and the complexity of interactions. <br><br>I am inspired by the work of Masanobu Fukuoka in observing and working with nature to create resilient and sustainable natural systems. Maintaining a close working relationship with natural systems is a vital part of my physical and emotional wellbeing.

My daughter Sofie is the light of my life. <br>Parenthood brings a whole new meaning to the word love.<br><img src="images/sofie_small.jpg">
