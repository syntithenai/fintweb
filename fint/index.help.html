<h3>EASY FINANCE SOFTWARE</h3>

The software is designed to minimise the amount of work to prepare personal finance and taxation information.<br/>
The target audience is small business and individuals.<br/>
The software reduces time spent on data entry by relying on electronic download of transaction records from online banking. <br/>
The software improves the quality of the information by using rule based categorisation to transactions. As the rule set grows, most transactions will be automatically categorised. <br/>
The software allows flexibility in adjusting the transaction data by providing splits and full transaction editing.<br/>
The software provides reports and graphical analysis to review the transactions by category and prepare printable tax reports for Australian small business.<br/>

There are many financial management packages out there catering to a range of requirements. This software defines itself by - 
<ol>
<li>Cross Platform Web Application. Completely client side browser based software development using javascript. Once the application has been downloaded into a web browser, Internet access is no longer required. The big advantage of using browser based technology is that it can be used on many types of computers including tablets and installation is as easy as visiting a website.</li>
<li>Secure Direct Online Banking Import. Import of banking information from online banking directly so electronic banking password stays secure. The main solution available currently requires giving electronic banking password to a third party so they can download information on your behalf which is a major security concern.</li>
<li>Smart Text Import. Highly flexible import of information using smart algorithms to extract relevant row data from pasted or uploaded transaction data.</li>
<li>Rules based categorisation with unique rule creation wizard.</li>
<li>Wizard workflow to ensure up to date transactions and then relevant reporting. Easy to use wizard to guide the user through the import, manage and report process and get the result quickly. Most financial applications are object based showing lists and forms for accounts, transactions, categories etc.</li>

<h4>Business Model</h4>
The main source of income from the application will be through advertising with Google.<br/>
Initially (08/04/2012) a documentation site for the underlying toolkit will be the main source of revenue. Broadly 1000 visitors each day worldwide can generate from $10-80/day. I believe with some good sample applications, the toolkit could generate that much interest.<br/>
A public website describing the FINT tools could also generate significant traffic if I create some useful content around the keywords - personal finance html5 application security offline.
There is much interest for innovations in browser based software. <br/>
Finally, ads embedded in the application(10/06/2012) will ultimately stabilise as the primary source of income.<br/>

In the personal financial management application market, the key differentiating features are about simplicity - the ability to import directly from a bank, and rule based categorisation.<br/>
In addition to these features, with an open approach in providing the software for free(with ads) and providing the open source code use to develop the software I hope to create a snowball of community support and interest supported by social networks.<br/>
In drawing from 'open source' credibility and community, other people could reuse the software to offer competitive products. By controlling the shared online resource of bank scraping algorithms and transaction mapping rules as well as being the first in the field my goal is to make a name as the best solution. Competition generates interest in the niche feature set.<br/>

Installable iPhone, Android and Chrome applications without advertising and additional features would be another revenue stream down the track.
